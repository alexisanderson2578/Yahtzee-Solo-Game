# Yahtzee-Solo-Game
In this program I created a user input based Yahtzee game. Run the YahtzeeSoloGameTester.java to run the whole game. You can also use the 
die object in this game (Die.java) with other die based games.

The Die object has all attributes of a die, the YahtzeeHand object contains all that is needed for one single hand.
The YahtzeeScoreCard creates a printable score table to keep track of the game and the YahtzeeSoloGame combines all objects using 
object oriented programing to play a game of Yahtzee.
